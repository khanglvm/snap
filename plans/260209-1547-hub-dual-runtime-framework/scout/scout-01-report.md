# Scout Report

## Relevant Files
- `/Users/khang/Documents/repo/snap/` - project root exists, minimal content.
- `/Users/khang/Documents/repo/snap/plans/` - created for planning artifacts.
- `/Users/khang/Documents/repo/snap/plans/260209-1547-hub-dual-runtime-framework/` - active plan directory.
- `/Users/khang/Documents/repo/snap/plans/260209-1547-hub-dual-runtime-framework/research/` - research reports location.
- `/Users/khang/Documents/repo/snap/plans/260209-1547-hub-dual-runtime-framework/reports/` - planning reports location.
- `/Users/khang/Documents/repo/snap/plans/260209-1547-hub-dual-runtime-framework/scout/` - scout reports location.

## Findings
- Repository currently has no discovered source code files.
- `README.md` does not exist in project root.
- `docs/` directory does not exist.
- Planning must assume greenfield bootstrap with no existing architecture constraints.

## Implications for Plan
- Include bootstrap phases for project scaffold, coding standards baseline, test harness, and sample modules.
- Include docs bootstrap inside plan scope where needed for framework adoption.

## Unresolved Questions
1. Should initial implementation be single package or monorepo layout?
2. Should framework include built-in templates/generator in v1?
3. Any required CI provider preference (GitHub Actions vs other)?
